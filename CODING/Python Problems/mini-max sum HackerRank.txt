Q1)- arr=[1,3,5,7,9]
The minimum sum 1+3+5+7=16 is  and the maximum sum is 3+5+7+9=24. The function prints 16 24

Print two space-separated long integers denoting the respective minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. (The output can be greater than a 32 bit integer.)

Sample Input

1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output

10 14
Explanation

The numbers are 1,2 ,3 ,4  and 5 . Calculate the following sums using four of the five integers:

Sum everything except 1 , the sum is 14 .
Sum everything except 2 , the sum is 13 .
Sum everything except 3 , the sum is 12 .
Sum everything except 4 , the sum is 11.
Sum everything except 5 , the sum is 10 .

                                                                                                 SOLUTION

def miniMaxSum(arr):
    arr.sort()
    s = sum(arr)
    maxResult = s - arr[0]
    minResult = s - arr[len(arr) - 1]
    
    print(minResult, maxResult)



arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

miniMaxSum(arr)
